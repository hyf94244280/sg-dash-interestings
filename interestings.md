- "Vehicles, Experiments in Synthetic Psychology" is a fascinating book to illustrate human behaviour using thought experiments. These thought experiments are in the form of vehicles. For example, ![](http://s15.postimg.org/y48cg27y3/Braitenberg_Vehicle_2ab.png)

> More light right → right wheel turns faster → turns towards the left, away from the light.
> This is more efficient as a behavior to escape from the light source, since the creature can move in different directions, and tends to orient towards the direction from which least light comes.
In another variation, the connections are negative or inhibitory: more light → slower movement. In this case, the agents move away from the dark and towards the light.

Kudos to Gabe for pointing out that this is a _Braitenberg Vehicle_. Also happens to be the author of the book.
