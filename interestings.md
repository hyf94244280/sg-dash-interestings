### Interestings

* [Fig](http://www.fig.sh/) has been replaced by [Docker Compose](https://github.com/docker/compose), and is now deprecated. [Announcing the release](http://blog.docker.com/2015/02/announcing-docker-compose/) (26 Feb 2015) on their blog, Compose is based directly on the Fig codebase and is backwards-compatible with Fig applications. Fig will continue to receive critical maintenance updates, but is now deprecated in favour of Compose.
